# Punish
Punishment awaits naughty Minecraft players. Punish players that you think are being inappropriate or misbehaving towards other players. Before you punish the targeted player, you must first specify a reason why this punishment was imposed on the targeted player. Secondly, you must select a punishment type. This can be a kick, a temporary ban, or a ban. Select the most appropriate punishment you think the player should receive. UUID is what is tied to your Minecraft account, and it can be seen on the punishment GUI. This is the targeted player's UUID, or universally unique identifier. You can also see the targeted player's name.
